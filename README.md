# 30 Days Of Solidity

This repository would contain 30 or more solidity smart contracts while explaining different concepts of the language. It aims to teach you smart contract development; hopefully.

## How to Use

Each folder is dedicated to each day.

Go to the contracts subfolder and go through the smart contract files. But, ignore the `Migrations.sol`.

Then, head on to the `README.md` to get an explaination of the smart contract.

Happy learning üòÅ
